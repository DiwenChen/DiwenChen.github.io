        - The game was developed in the Game Engine course with my partner, Dennis. <br> <br>
        - It was a one-week project built using a text-based engine and C++. <br> <br>
        - In Cull the Weak, the player shoots down enemy fighters while dodging their bullets. <br><br>
        - Player can also bomb ground targets for extra points. <br><br>
        - The game continues indefinitely; the goal is to score the highest points possible before death. <br>

        - Spring was a one-week IGDA game jam game developed with my friends, Ethan and Hung. <br><br>
        - The theme was to base a game around a polysemous word, so "spring" is a perfect candidate. <br><br>
        - We used Unity for the project, and I was responsible for player movement and level design. <br><br>
        - The game is a 2D platformer. The player plays as a spring and tries to escape from the hot springs. <br><br>
        - Win by reaching the end of the level. <br>

    <p3>
        - Don't Get Lost was an IGDA game jam game developed by me over three days. <br><br>
        - The theme was to use unfamiliar tools, so it was my first time using Unreal. <br><br>
        - Inspired by Stanley's Parable, I created a simple, narrative-driven walking game. <br><br>
        - It is the player's choice to collaborate or fight with the imaginary narrator. <br>
